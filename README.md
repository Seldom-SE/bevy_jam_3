# Radiation Situation

Run `cargo run` to run natively
Source: https://github.com/Seldom-SE/bevy_jam_3

## Premise

Survive as long as you can in a nuclear wasteland! Radiation can damage your health, but as a
**side effect**, you'll power nearby machines and see in the dark!

## Controls

- WASD to move
- Space to pick up nearby items
- Left click items in your inventory (at the bottom of the screen) to use them
    - Use cans of tuna (the apocalypse wasn't so bad) to increase your food level
    - Use fuel tanks to fuel a nearby generator (which will power nearby machines)
    - Use constructs (generators, assemblers, and turrets) to build them
    - The other items are for crafting
- Right click items in your inventory to drop them
- Left click items in the crafting bar (at the left side of the screen) while near a powered
assembler to craft them

## Hints (spoilers!)

- Look for structures to loot
- Structures may have assemblers, which you can use to craft items, if you have the materials and
enough radiation to power the assembler
- Try to keep your radiation between 50 and 80
- The world isn't infinite
- Watch your radiation! Many things increase it.
    - Including generators, as a **side effect** of running them
- Always be on the hunt for delicious tuna
- Slimes generate with the world, but robots (called rustaches) spawn near you increasingly often
- Slimes can't go through walls, but rustaches can. Whoops.
- Make a home base with many turrets and a few generators. Leave spare items on the ground there.
    - If you keep getting lost, make your base at the edge of the map, and follow the border
    to find your way back
